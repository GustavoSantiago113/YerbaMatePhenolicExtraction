# Yerba Mate Phenolic Extraction Analysis

## Introduction

## Objective

This repository provides tools for analyzing and predicting Total Polyphenol Content (TPC) in yerba mate aqueous extracts before a Folin-Cicalteau assay using image processing and machine learning. The system uses RGB and HSV color features along with pH measurements to estimate phenolic compound concentrations.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/GustavoSantiago113/YerbaMatePhenolicExtraction.git
cd YerbaMatePhenolicExtraction
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repository Structure

### Color Extraction [colorsExtraction](colorsExtraction/)

Tool for extracting color features from yerba mate extract images obtained using a cellphone camera and the [image capture chamber]().

**Usage:**
1. Place your images in the "images" folder
2. Run the color extraction script:

```python
python colorsExtraction/colorExtraction.py
```

3. Follow the GUI prompts:
   * Select folder containing images
   * Click on points of interest in each image
   * Confirm selection using the button
4. After iterating over all images of the foler, the results will be saved in colorsExtraction/color_points.csv

### Data Analysis [dataAnalysis](dataAnalysis/)

Contains scripts in R and Python for model training and evaluation.

**Components:**

* data-analysis.R: R script for initial data analysis, feature selections with XGB-Boruta and Pearson Correlation and visualization.

* modelsWithOptuna.py: Implements and optimizes multiple machine learning models using Optuna:
    * Gradient Boosting
    * XGBoost
    * Elastic Net
    * SVM
    * Polynomial Regression
    * A simple Neural Network
  
* modelExport.py: Exports the best performing model (Elastic Net) for implementation.
  
* Output files:
    * model_metrics_optuna.csv: Performance metrics for all models.
    * best_hyperparameters.txt: Optimized parameters for each model.
    * model_comparisons_optuna.png: Visual comparison of model performances.

### Implementation [implementation.py](implementation.py)

Interactive tool for predicting TPC from new images using the trained model.

**Usage:**
1. Run the implementation script:

```python
python implementation.py
```
2. Follow the interactive steps:
    * Select an image when prompted
    * Click on a point in the image to analyze
    * Enter the pH value in the text box
    * Click "Confirm" to get the TPC prediction

## Model Performance

The implemented Elastic Net model achieves:

* RMSE: 128.53
* RRMSE: 40.66%
* KGE: 0.696
* RÂ²: 0.612

## Data Requirements

* Input images should be well-lit photographs of yerba mate extract inside the cuvette within the [image capture chamber]().
* pH measurements.
* Supported image formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp
